
   ***********************   End to End Test **********************  
   In end-to-end testing, I focus on testing the application as a whole, simulating real-user scenarios. 
   I first identify critical workflows (e.g., user registration, login, trading actions) and then ensure that data flows seamlessly across the front-end, back-end, and database. 
   I use automation tools like Selenium or Playwright for front-end testing, integrating with back-end APIs using tools like Rest Assured to verify the communication between layers.
   I also check the interaction with databases and ensure that the entire system works together as expected. 
   CI/CD pipelines ensure that tests are executed after each code change, and the feedback loop is quick for effective delivery.
   
   
   ************* Test a trading system? **************************
   
   Functional Testing: Verifying that trading actions (buy, sell, balance checks) are executed correctly, 
                       and the system reflects real-time data.
   Integration Testing: Ensuring that trading operations are correctly interacting with 
                       back-end services like databases, payment systems, and external APIs.	
   Security Testing: Ensuring there are no vulnerabilities like unauthorized transactions, data leakage, 
                     and ensuring compliance with financial regulations.					   
   UI Testing: Verifying the user interface for accuracy, clarity, and responsiveness, ensuring that critical alerts are displayed.
   
   **************   
   For Front-End:  I write automated UI tests using Selenium or Playwright, targeting user flows, interactions, and visual elements. 
                   I also ensure that edge cases like form validations, error messages, and responsive design are covered. Additionally, 
				   I use Flutter_test for mobile app testing.
				   
  For Back-End  :    I focus on API testing using Rest Assured to verify endpoints, data integrity, and responses under various conditions.
                     I also test error handling and edge cases like invalid inputs or timeouts.
				   
  For Integration : I use Mockito to mock dependencies in unit tests and ensure that services work as 
                    expected when integrated with external systems like databases or third-party APIs.
					
					
					********************************				
					 Scenario Base 
1 . Scenario: Testing Real-Time Price Updates
            Use WebSocket testing tools (e.g., websocket-client or Postman).
            Verify prices update as per market conditions without delays.
            Validate data integrity and accuracy by cross-checking with an external market feed.	
2.  Scenario: Order Execution Testing	
         Place test orders (buy/sell, market, and limit orders) and verify execution.
         Test edge cases such as insufficient balance, invalid order parameters, or placing orders during non-trading hours.
         Validate order status updates via API and UI using automated scripts (Selenium for UI, Rest Assured for API).		 
3. Scenario: Trade Lifecycle Validation
        Simulate order placement, confirmation, partial fills, and settlement.
        Validate backend database updates for trade records.
        Test cancellation/modification of active orders and verify expected outcomes.	
4. Scenario: Performance Testing of Trade Execution	
	   Simulate high trade volumes using load testing tools like k6 or JMeter.
       Monitor response times, throughput, and error rates during peak load.
       Validate that the platform handles spikes without degrading performance.
       Use monitoring tools like Grafana to analyze bottlenecks in real-time.	   
 5.Scenario: Testing Risk Management Rules  
	  Test scenarios like margin calls, stop-loss execution, and maximum leverage limits.
      Validate user account balances and positions after a trade.
      Use automated scripts to simulate trades that breach risk limits and verify system behavior (e.g., rejecting trades).

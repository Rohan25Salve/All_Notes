******************                         ETD (Exchange-Traded Derivatives)                *************************

ETD are derivative contracts (their value comes from an underlying like stocks, indices, FX, commodities) that are traded on a regulated exchange with standardized terms.
Common ETD types

Futures – obligation to buy/sell at a future date & price
Options – right (not obligation) to buy/sell
Index derivatives – Nifty, S&P 500, FTSE, etc.
Commodity derivatives – Gold, Oil, Agri products

You expect ABC stock to rise next month.
Today price: ₹1,000
You buy ABC Futures @ ₹1,020 (1-month expiry)
After 1 month:
Price = ₹1,080 → Profit = ₹60
Price = ₹980 → Loss = ₹40
You didn’t buy the stock directly; you traded its future price.

ETD trade lifecycle (high level)
Trade placed on exchange
Margin blocked
Trade matched
Clearing house novates (becomes buyer to seller & vice-versa)
Daily MTM (Mark-to-Market)
Expiry / square-off / physical or cash settlement


ETD in banking & trading systems (like T24)
Used for hedging (FX, interest rate, equity risk)
Automated margin, MTM, expiry, settlement
Strong controls & validations → good for STP

ETD = standardized derivative contracts traded on exchanges, cleared by a clearing house, offering transparency, liquidity, and reduced counterparty risk.


🟢 Inbound (➡️ coming IN to T24)
Inbound = data / message / request that comes INTO Temenos T24 from outside systems

Think like this 👇  -->  Inbound = someone tells T24 to do something

ETD examples (Inbound)
Trade sent from Trading System / Exchange
File or API message asking T24 to book a trade
Message to update trade details


🔵 Outbound (⬅️ going OUT from T24)

Outbound = data / message / notification that goes FROM T24 to other systems

Think like this 👇 --> Outbound = T24 tells others what happened

ETD examples (Outbound)
Margin posting sent to Accounting / GL
MTM result sent to Risk system
Settlement confirmation sent to Exchange / Back office

   Premium Style --> Premium style = WHEN money is charged
   
   Option Style (Pay first)):
   Premium exchanged at inception
   Real cash movement immediately

   Real-life example
   You book a movie ticket:
                           You pay first
                           Then you watch movie
In T24 terms : Premium is paid at trade booking (inception) , Happens before expiry / exercise / assignment , Money moves immediately

If Premium Style = OPTION
✔ Check premium at DX.TRADE creation
✔ Do NOT expect premium later

   Future Style:
   NO premium at inception
   Settlement happens at: 
Assignment (Seller is forced) : SELL to Open option
Exercise (Buyer chooses): BUY to Open option
Expiry (No one acts): Both BUY and SELL sides
Real-life example : Option expires , No one exercised or assigned.
Maturity (Futures only): FUTURES, not options   , Future contract reaches end date.


| Premium Style | Settlement timing                        |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Option Style  | Premium at booking + settlement at event |
| Future Style  | Settlement only at event                 |

Buy → Exercise
Sell → Assignment
Do nothing → Expiry
Future → Maturity



In T24 terms
No premium at inception
Money moves during lifecycle event
Settlement happens at: Exercise , Assignment , Expiry ,Maturity

Real-life example
You go to restaurant:
Eat first
Pay after eating

👉 This is FUTURE premium style

   Future Style = “Accounting is deferred”

If Premium Style = FUTURE
✔ No premium at booking
✔ Expect payout during event

“Settlement Method” --> how the trade is finished at the end
CASH settlement ((Money only)) ->
You bet on NIFTY index:
                      You cannot buy NIFTY
                      You only get profit / loss money
In T24 terms
No share / no bond / no commodity
Only accounting entries

 What you SEE in T24

✅ DX Trade → CLOSED
✅ Accounting entry
❌ NO SEC.TRADE

Typical instruments = CASH
Equity Index
FX Cash
Volatility
OFU (Future into cash)

PHYSICAL settlement (Asset + money) -> 
You buy TCS share option:
                       If exercised → you receive shares
                       You also pay money

In T24 terms
Security must be delivered
New SEC.TRADE is created
Then trade closes

What you SEE in T24

✅ DX Trade → CLOSED
✅ SEC.TRADE created
✅ SEC.TRADE status = IHLD / AUTH
✅ Accounting entries

   |
   |-- FUTURE ------------------ FUTURE_STYLE only


Example: Gold price = $2,000 per ounce 
OPTION × OPTION_STYLE
“Pay now, decide later.”
Real life
You pay $100 today to get the right to buy gold at $2,000 after 1 month.
If gold → $2,200 → you exercise
If gold → $1,800 → you walk away
Your maximum loss = $100


Contract Type  : OPTION
Premium Style  : OPTION_STYLE
Option Type    : CALL
Strike Price   : 2000
Premium        : 100 (paid today)

 OPTION × FUTURE_STYLE
“No premium today, settle later” ← 🔥 IMPORTANT
Real life

You do not pay $100 today.

Instead:
You agree on $2,000
Profit/Loss is settled later
You still have a right, not obligation

You MUST still agree on:
BUY or SELL
PRICE
Otherwise the contract is meaningless.

Contract Type  : OPTION
Premium Style  : FUTURE_STYLE
Option Type    : CALL
Strike Price   : 2000
Premium        : NONE upfront
Settlement     : At maturity


FUTURE × FUTURE_STYLE
“No choice, compulsory trade”
Real life
You must buy gold at $2,000 after 1 month.
No right to walk away
No premium
Both sides obligated

Contract Type  : FUTURE
Premium Style  : FUTURE_STYLE
Option Type    : ❌
Strike Price   : ❌



RESULTANT_TRADE   ----> 

RESULTANT_TRADE} - Event type for resultant trade ("101") --> a new trade generated as a result of a previous trade lifecycle action (exercise / assignment / closeout).
Your flow simplified:
Buy to Open option trade
Trade goes to HILD
Trade corrected → LIVE
Exercise / Assignment
Original trade → CLOSED
System allows new trade creation
🔑 That new trade is created with Event Type = 101

A resultant trade is:
A trade created because something happened to another trade
Not created independently by a dealer




Reverse Trade  --> 
In real banking systems:
You cannot delete a trade
You cannot overwrite history

👉 You must reverse it

🏦 Real-World Analogy (Non-Banking)
Wrong train ticket example 🚆
You buy a ticket to Delhi
Realize you needed Mumbai

Ticket system:
Does NOT delete Delhi ticket
Issues refund (reversal)
You buy new Mumbai ticket

You travel correctly
👉 Refund = Reverse trade
👉 New ticket = Rectified trade (Event 300)









 *****************************************************************************************************************************************************

Traditional equity trade
* Buy shares once
* Sell shares once
* Profit/loss depends only on entry & exit

Problem for banks & clients
Clients want regular accumulation
Want discounted buying
Want structured risk
Want automation over time

➡️ Result: Structured Products

STRUCTURED PRODUCT (SP) -->
A contract that combines derivatives + rules + lifecycle events
It is:
Long-running (weeks/months)
Event-driven
Rule-based
Heavy on valuation, accrual, fixing, maturity
* Accumulator / Decumulator is one type of SP.


Accumulator = agreement to buy shares every working day at a fixed price
Not optional
Not one-time
Obligatory & repeated

Real-life analogy
Imagine:
You promise to buy 10 apples daily
Price fixed at ₹50
Market price keeps changing
You must buy anyway
That’s an Accumulator.

Decumulator --> Agreement to sell shares every working day at a fixed price

| Term         | Meaning                    |
| ------------ | -------------------------- |
| Underlying   | The share (e.g. Apple)     |
| Strike Price | Fixed agreed price         |
| Market Price | Today’s live price         |
| Daily Units  | Units per day              |
| Accrual      | Daily obligation recording |
| Fixing       | Settlement checkpoint      |
| Knock-out    | Early termination trigger  |
| Maturity     | Natural end of contract    |

Every working day (COB):
System reads market price
Compares with strike
Calculates accrued units
Updates:ACCRUED.UNITS1


Example
Strike = 50
Market = 45
Daily Units = 100
The customer must buy 100 shares at 50, even though the market is 45
➡️ Customer is at a loss

GEARING (RISK MULTIPLIER) --> “If market goes against you, buy MORE shares”
This is Gearing Factor
Example
Daily Units = 100
Gearing = 2
Market < Strike
➡️ Accrued Units = 200

KNOCK-IN & KNOCK-OUT -->
Knock-In
Accrual starts only after price touches a level

Knock-Out
Contract terminates early
No more accrual
Final settlement triggered

Example
Knock-out = 60
Market hits 60
➡️ Contract ends

Example (Knock-In)
Product setup
Underlying: ABC Stock
Strike: 50
Knock-In level: 55
Accrual: 1 unit per day
Tenor: 10 days

| Day   | Market Price | Accrual               |
| ----- | ------------ | --------------------- |
| Day 1 | 52           | ❌ No (not knocked-in) |
| Day 2 | 54           | ❌ No                  |
| Day 3 | **55**       | ✅ Knock-In triggered  |
| Day 4 | 56           | ✅ 1 unit              |
| Day 5 | 57           | ✅ 1 unit              |

2️⃣ Knock-Out (KO)
Meaning:
👉 If price hits the KO level, the contract ends immediately.

No more accrual.
Settlement happens early.

Example (Knock-Out)
Product setup
Knock-Out level: 60
Accrual per day: 1 unit

| Day   | Market Price | Accrual      |
| ----- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Day 1 | 56           | +1           |
| Day 2 | 58           | +1           |
| Day 3 | **60**       | 🚨 Knock-Out |




FIXING -->
Fixing = periodic settlement checkpoint
“Okay, enough accrual — now settle”

What happens in Fixing?
Accrued units are:
Exercised
Settled (cash / shares)
Residual option expires

Status updated:
FIXED = YES
Each fixing period:
Stored as multi-value set
Cannot be edited after fixing

Why fixing exists?
Avoid waiting till maturity
Reduce risk
Allow partial settlement

Example — Accrual Product WITH Fixing
Product setup
Accrual: 1 unit per valid day
Fixing frequency: Monthly
Tenor: 3 months
| Day      | Accrual  |
| -------- | -------- |
| Day 1–20 | 20 units |


📍 Fixing Date (End of Month 1)
✔ 20 units are:
Exercised
Settled (cash/shares)

Month 2
| Day      | Accrual  |
| -------- | -------- |
| Day 1–18 | 18 units |


Month 3
Same logic again.

Fixing 1 → 20 units → FIXED = YES
Fixing 2 → 18 units → FIXED = YES
Fixing 3 → 22 units → FIXED = YES

With fixing:
✅ Partial settlement
✅ Risk reduced over time
✅ Cash flows earlier


🔰 LEVEL 9 — UNWIND (EARLY EXIT)
Client can exit:
Fully
Partially

Full Unwind
Contract closed
No future accrual

Partial Unwind
Daily units reduced
Accrual continues on reduced quantity

📌 Important:
Unwind effective date matters
Back-dated unwind needs manual corrections

NOVATION (TRANSFER OF CONTRACT)
What is novation?
Moving the contract from one party to another

Types:
Internal: Client A → Client B (same bank)
External: Client → outside entity
Optional fees apply.


ACCOUNTING VIEW (High level)
Accumulator creates:

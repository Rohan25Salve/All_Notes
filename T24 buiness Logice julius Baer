******************                         ETD (Exchange-Traded Derivatives)                *************************

ETD are derivative contracts (their value comes from an underlying like stocks, indices, FX, commodities) that are traded on a regulated exchange with standardized terms.
Common ETD types

Futures – obligation to buy/sell at a future date & price
Options – right (not obligation) to buy/sell
Index derivatives – Nifty, S&P 500, FTSE, etc.
Commodity derivatives – Gold, Oil, Agri products

You expect ABC stock to rise next month.
Today price: ₹1,000
You buy ABC Futures @ ₹1,020 (1-month expiry)
After 1 month:
Price = ₹1,080 → Profit = ₹60
Price = ₹980 → Loss = ₹40
You didn’t buy the stock directly; you traded its future price.

ETD trade lifecycle (high level)
Trade placed on exchange
Margin blocked
Trade matched
Clearing house novates (becomes buyer to seller & vice-versa)
Daily MTM (Mark-to-Market)
Expiry / square-off / physical or cash settlement


ETD in banking & trading systems (like T24)
Used for hedging (FX, interest rate, equity risk)
Automated margin, MTM, expiry, settlement
Strong controls & validations → good for STP

ETD = standardized derivative contracts traded on exchanges, cleared by a clearing house, offering transparency, liquidity, and reduced counterparty risk.


🟢 Inbound (➡️ coming IN to T24)
Inbound = data / message / request that comes INTO Temenos T24 from outside systems

Think like this 👇  -->  Inbound = someone tells T24 to do something

ETD examples (Inbound)
Trade sent from Trading System / Exchange
File or API message asking T24 to book a trade
Message to update trade details


🔵 Outbound (⬅️ going OUT from T24)

Outbound = data / message / notification that goes FROM T24 to other systems

Think like this 👇 --> Outbound = T24 tells others what happened

ETD examples (Outbound)
Margin posting sent to Accounting / GL
MTM result sent to Risk system
Settlement confirmation sent to Exchange / Back office

| Type       | Meaning                             |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Option** | Right, not obligation               |
| **Future** | Obligation                          |
| **OFU**    | Option whose underlying is a Future |


   OFU = Option on Futures
   Used heavily in:

   Premium Style --> Premium style = WHEN money is charged
   
   Option Style (Pay first)):
   Premium exchanged at inception
   Real cash movement immediately

   Real-life example
   You book a movie ticket:
                           You pay first
                           Then you watch movie
In T24 terms : Premium is paid at trade booking (inception) , Happens before expiry / exercise / assignment , Money moves immediately

If Premium Style = OPTION
✔ Check premium at DX.TRADE creation
✔ Do NOT expect premium later

   Future Style:
   NO premium at inception
   Settlement happens at: 
Assignment (Seller is forced) : SELL to Open option
Exercise (Buyer chooses): BUY to Open option
Expiry (No one acts): Both BUY and SELL sides
Real-life example : Option expires , No one exercised or assigned.
Maturity (Futures only): FUTURES, not options   , Future contract reaches end date.


| Premium Style | Settlement timing                        |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Option Style  | Premium at booking + settlement at event |
| Future Style  | Settlement only at event                 |

Buy → Exercise
Sell → Assignment
Do nothing → Expiry
Future → Maturity



In T24 terms
No premium at inception
Money moves during lifecycle event
Settlement happens at: Exercise , Assignment , Expiry ,Maturity

Real-life example
You go to restaurant:
Eat first
Pay after eating

👉 This is FUTURE premium style

   Future Style = “Accounting is deferred”

If Premium Style = FUTURE
✔ No premium at booking
✔ Expect payout during event

FX Cash
Volatility
OFU (Future into cash)

PHYSICAL settlement (Asset + money) -> 
You buy TCS share option:
                       If exercised → you receive shares
                       You also pay money

In T24 terms
Security must be delivered
New SEC.TRADE is created

Example: Gold price = $2,000 per ounce 
OPTION × OPTION_STYLE
“Pay now, decide later.”
Real life
You pay $100 today to get the right to buy gold at $2,000 after 1 month.
If gold → $2,200 → you exercise
If gold → $1,800 → you walk away
Your maximum loss = $100


Contract Type  : OPTION
Premium Style  : OPTION_STYLE
Option Type    : CALL
Strike Price   : 2000
Premium        : 100 (paid today)

 OPTION × FUTURE_STYLE
“No premium today, settle later” ← 🔥 IMPORTANT
Real life

You do not pay $100 today.

Instead:
You agree on $2,000
Profit/Loss is settled later
You still have a right, not obligation

You MUST still agree on:
BUY or SELL
PRICE
Otherwise the contract is meaningless.

Contract Type  : OPTION
Premium Style  : FUTURE_STYLE
Option Type    : CALL
Strike Price   : 2000
Premium        : NONE upfront
Settlement     : At maturity


FUTURE × FUTURE_STYLE
“No choice, compulsory trade”
Real life
You must buy gold at $2,000 after 1 month.
No right to walk away
No premium
Both sides obligated

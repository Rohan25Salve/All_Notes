******************                         ETD (Exchange-Traded Derivatives)                *************************

ETD are derivative contracts (their value comes from an underlying like stocks, indices, FX, commodities) that are traded on a regulated exchange with standardized terms.
Common ETD types

Futures – obligation to buy/sell at a future date & price
Options – right (not obligation) to buy/sell
Index derivatives – Nifty, S&P 500, FTSE, etc.
Commodity derivatives – Gold, Oil, Agri products

You expect ABC stock to rise next month.
Today price: ₹1,000
You buy ABC Futures @ ₹1,020 (1-month expiry)
After 1 month:
Price = ₹1,080 → Profit = ₹60
Price = ₹980 → Loss = ₹40
You didn’t buy the stock directly; you traded its future price.

ETD trade lifecycle (high level)
Trade placed on exchange
Margin blocked
Trade matched
Clearing house novates (becomes buyer to seller & vice-versa)
Daily MTM (Mark-to-Market)
Expiry / square-off / physical or cash settlement


ETD in banking & trading systems (like T24)
Used for hedging (FX, interest rate, equity risk)
Automated margin, MTM, expiry, settlement
Strong controls & validations → good for STP

ETD = standardized derivative contracts traded on exchanges, cleared by a clearing house, offering transparency, liquidity, and reduced counterparty risk.


🟢 Inbound (➡️ coming IN to T24)
Inbound = data / message / request that comes INTO Temenos T24 from outside systems

Think like this 👇  -->  Inbound = someone tells T24 to do something

ETD examples (Inbound)
Trade sent from Trading System / Exchange
File or API message asking T24 to book a trade
Message to update trade details


🔵 Outbound (⬅️ going OUT from T24)

Outbound = data / message / notification that goes FROM T24 to other systems

Think like this 👇 --> Outbound = T24 tells others what happened

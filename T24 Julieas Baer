*******       OpenAPI   ************

OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) is a standard specification used to describe REST APIs.
Key Points

Defines endpoints, request/response formats, parameters, headers, security, etc.
Written in YAML or JSON.
Helps automate:
API documentation
Client SDK generation
Server stub generation
API testing (Postman, Rest Assured, Karate, etc.)
Temenos exposes its services through the Interaction Framework (IF) or REST services, and each service has an OpenAPI (Swagger) specification that describes:
API endpoint
Request/response structure
Parameters
Authentication
Error codes
Field validation rules
T24 function to trigger (e.g., enrichment, commit, COB, etc.)
* This is a blueprint for QA to understand the T24 service without reading COB tables or internal code.

Step 1: Read the OpenAPI Spec  --> Understand all fields, constraints, and sample payloads.
Step 2: Prepare Test Payload --> Create valid/invalid payloads based on OpenAPI.
Step 3: Trigger T24 API --> Call the REST API using Postman/automation scripts.
Step 4: Validate API Response
Check: HTTP code, Error messages, T24 transaction ID, Business rule execution
Step 5: Validate T24 Database --> In AA/AC/FT tables after commit.
Step 6: Validate End-to-End Flow  --> T24 → Middleware → Channels → Notifications → Accounting entries.

T24 Component Testing
Temenos T24 has modules:
AA (Arrangement Architecture)
CB (Core Banking)
COB (Close of Business)
FT (Funds Transfer)
PM (Payments)
LC (Lending)


**************   AVRO  **********************
It is used in the integration layer when T24 communicates with:
Kafka
Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)
Data Lake / Analytics
Downstream systems (Cards, AML, CRM, Notifications)
👉 T24 → Middleware → Kafka (Avro messages)

Flow  --->
API call hits T24 (OpenAPI)
T24 validates & commits data
Event generated
Event serialized in Avro
Published to Kafka topic
Consumers read Avro event

Where AVRO is used in T24  -->
📌 1. Customer Events -> Customer Created , KYC Updated , CIF Modified
📌 2. Account Events --> Account Opened , Balance Updated , Account Closed
📌 3. Transaction Events --> Funds Transfer , Card transaction , Loan disbursement
📌 4. Loan & AA Events --> Loan approved , Installment posted , Loan closed

*******************          T24 service configuration records.   **************


TSA.SERVICE,
AUTO/I/PROCESS,
AUTOMATION01/******/SG0020001,
HKD^JBWW.B.DX.FXOPTIONS.PROCESS,
SERVICE.CONTROL::=AUTO


Note --> “This background process is allowed to run automatically (AUTO) without manual intervention.”
Without this:
Your OFS automation will fail
Trades will be created but not processed
Accounting / lifecycle will not move forward

| Part                        | Meaning                                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| TSA.SERVICE                 | T24 table that controls background services |
| AUTO/I/PROCESS              | Type of service (Automatic Input / Process) |
| AUTOMATION01                | User used to run automation                 |
| SG0020001                   | Company/booking entity                    |
| HKD                         | Currency                                    |
| JBWW.B.DX.FXOPTIONS.PROCESS | Actual business engine                      |
| SERVICE.CONTROL::=AUTO      | Enable auto execution                       |


T24 is strict about: Currency, Product, Process type, Company

FX OPTIONS Processing -->   JBWW.B.DX.FXOPTIONS.PROCESS    ---> 
👉 Handles:
FX Option trade processing
Lifecycle events
Valuation triggers

FX STRUCTURES Processing  --> FX STRUCTURES Processing  ---> 
👉 Handles:
Structured FX products
Combination instruments
Strategy-level processing

FX CASH Processing -->  JBWW.D.FX.CASH.PROCESS --> 
👉 Handles:
Cash leg settlements
Debit/credit postings
Nostro movements

OFS Message Service -->  BNK^OFS.MESSAGE.SERVICE -->
It allows:
OFS messages to be accepted
Requests to be processed
Responses to be returned

SERVICE.CONTROL::=AUTO -->  “Run this service automatically in background when needed.”
MANUAL → someone must trigger it
STOPPED → nothing happens
AUTO → perfect for automation

SERVER.NAME=NULL --> 
Simple meaning:
Service can run on any available T24 server
No server pinning
Better for automation & load

automation user AUTOMATION01  ---> 
Because:
Automation should not use real users
Easier auditing
Controlled permissions

*******       OpenAPI   ************

OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) is a standard specification used to describe REST APIs.
Key Points

Defines endpoints, request/response formats, parameters, headers, security, etc.
Written in YAML or JSON.
Helps automate:
API documentation
Client SDK generation
Server stub generation
API testing (Postman, Rest Assured, Karate, etc.)
Temenos exposes its services through the Interaction Framework (IF) or REST services, and each service has an OpenAPI (Swagger) specification that describes:
API endpoint
Request/response structure
Parameters
Authentication
Error codes
Field validation rules
T24 function to trigger (e.g., enrichment, commit, COB, etc.)
* This is a blueprint for QA to understand the T24 service without reading COB tables or internal code.

Step 1: Read the OpenAPI Spec  --> Understand all fields, constraints, and sample payloads.
Step 2: Prepare Test Payload --> Create valid/invalid payloads based on OpenAPI.
Step 3: Trigger T24 API --> Call the REST API using Postman/automation scripts.
Step 4: Validate API Response
Check: HTTP code, Error messages, T24 transaction ID, Business rule execution
Step 5: Validate T24 Database --> In AA/AC/FT tables after commit.
Step 6: Validate End-to-End Flow  --> T24 → Middleware → Channels → Notifications → Accounting entries.

T24 Component Testing
Temenos T24 has modules:
AA (Arrangement Architecture)
CB (Core Banking)
COB (Close of Business)
FT (Funds Transfer)
PM (Payments)
LC (Lending)


**************   AVRO  **********************
It is used in the integration layer when T24 communicates with:
Kafka
Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)
Data Lake / Analytics
Downstream systems (Cards, AML, CRM, Notifications)
👉 T24 → Middleware → Kafka (Avro messages)

Flow  --->
API call hits T24 (OpenAPI)
T24 validates & commits data
Event generated
Event serialized in Avro
Published to Kafka topic
Consumers read Avro event

Where AVRO is used in T24  -->
📌 1. Customer Events -> Customer Created , KYC Updated , CIF Modified
📌 2. Account Events --> Account Opened , Balance Updated , Account Closed
📌 3. Transaction Events --> Funds Transfer , Card transaction , Loan disbursement
📌 4. Loan & AA Events --> Loan approved , Installment posted , Loan closed

<-- Introduction add on this Scripte -->
   
	 My expertise lies in designing and implementing automated test cases using tools like TestMaster, Selenium, RestAssured ,
	 Iâ€™ve worked extensively on banking applications, including the Avaloq Core Platform,
	 where Iâ€™ve automated functional, integration, and end-to-end test scenarios.
	 Iâ€™m also familiar with database validation using SQL and PL/SQL.
	 
	              <--  What is Avaloq  --> 
		Avaloq Core Platform is a banking system that provides core banking functionalities such as transactions, wealth management,
		and regulatory compliance. It is widely used in private banking and wealth management institutions
		
		âœ… Portfolio Management â€“ Handles client portfolios, investments.
        âœ… Order Management System (OMS) â€“ Manages trade orders.
        âœ… Corporate Actions â€“ Handles dividends, stock splits.
        âœ… Payments & Settlements â€“ Executes fund transfers.
        âœ… Regulatory Compliance â€“ Ensures adherence to financial regulations.
		
		TestMaster ->
		 TestMaster is Avaloq's built-in test automation tool, used to automate UI workflows in Smart Client and validate banking transactions.
			
		Automation Testing Components of the Framework -->
		               Cucumber â†’ BDD layer for test scenarios  (calling TestMaster scripts inside step definitions.)
                       TestMaster â€“ UI automation for Avaloq Smart Client (TestMaster directly interacts with the Avaloq database, business logic, 
					                                                        and transactions, ensuring that core banking functions work correctly.)
                       Selenium WebDriver â€“ Web UI testing (Smart Client, Web interactions)
                       RestAssured â€“ API automation for Avaloq services(external banking services, APIs, and third-party platforms.)
                       PL/SQL Queries â€“ Database validation (Oracle DB)
                       TestNG/JUnit â€“ Test execution & reporting
                       Maven/Gradle â€“ Build management
                       Git/Jenkins â€“ CI/CD integration					 
           âœ… End-to-End Coverage â†’ TestMaster (Smart Client) + Selenium (Web) + API + DB
           	
       
          Challenges in Using TestMaster -->
          Limited to Avaloq Smart Client â€“ cannot test web applications.
		  Cannot handle complex API automation â€“ We need use Postman/RestAssured instead.
		  
		                  
						  Use of TestMaster ->
               Automates UI-based tests for Avaloq Smart Client.
               Supports parameter-driven testing, reducing manual effort.
               Ensures banking transactions work as expected after system updates.
               Supports integration with Avaloq APIs and databases for end-to-end validation.
			   Execution Logging & Reporting â€“ Provides detailed execution logs.
               Supports Regression Testing â€“ Helps test Avaloq updates efficiently.
			   
			   	   
			   When Would UI Automation Be Needed?
              *If there are manual processes in Avaloq Smart Client that require frequent UI interactions, 
			  then desktop automation tools like TestComplete, Ranorex, or AutoIt may be needed.
              *However, majority of Avaloq testing is backend-driven, so TestMaster is preferred.

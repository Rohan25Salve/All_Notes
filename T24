What is T24?
T24 (now called Temenos Transact) is a Core Banking Software developed by Temenos.
It’s one of the most widely used core banking systems (CBS) across the globe, deployed by retail banks, corporate banks, microfinance institutions, and Islamic banks.
Usage: It helps banks manage customer accounts, deposits, loans, payments, treasury, trade finance, compliance, and reporting.

T24 layers for testing:
1. Presentation Layer
What it is: User Interfaces – browser (Web), mobile app, desktop.
Testing focus:
- UI rendering and navigation
- Screen field validations
- Multi-language and localization
- Browser/device compatibility
- Accessibility 

2. Application Layer (Business Logic Layer)
What it is: Core banking business rules and workflows within T24 modules (e.g., Accounts, Loans, Deposits, Payments).
Testing focus:
- Functional validation of product configuration (e.g., account creation, interest calculation, charges).
- End-to-end transaction flows across modules.
- Parameter and version testing.
- COB (Close of Business) / EOD (End of Day) testing.
- Regression of business rules after upgrades.

3. Integration Layer
What it is: Interfaces via T24 Integration Framework (TAFJ/IRIS/TCIB), APIs, MQ, ESB, Kafka, or REST/SOAP web services.
Testing focus:
- API/Interface contract validation
- Message formatting (ISO20022, SWIFT, XML, JSON)
- Middleware queue handling (MQ/Kafka)
- Real-time and batch integrations with external systems (CRM, Cards, Payments, AML, Reporting).
- Error handling and retry logic.

4. Database Layer
What it is: Underlying database (Oracle, DB2, MS SQL depending on deployment).
Testing focus:
- Data integrity and consistency
- Record locking and transaction management
- COB batch updates and rollbacks
- Performance of complex queries
- Data migration/ETL validation

5. Infrastructure Layer
What it is: Hosting and deployment environment (On-prem / Cloud). Includes OS, app server, network, clustering, containerization.
Testing focus:
- High availability, DR (Disaster Recovery)
- Failover and load balancing
- Performance testing under peak load
- Security (authentication, authorization, encryption)
- Monitoring and logging

Issues which may arise at different layers:
 UI bug, integration message mismatch, database corruption, or infrastructure bottleneck

***********************************************************************************************************************************************************


What is MQ(Message queue):
MQ stands for Message Queue, typically referring to IBM MQ (WebSphere MQ) in banking environments.
It’s a middleware messaging system that lets applications exchange data asynchronously.
MQ = Middleware for asynchronous message exchange (queue-based)
Asynchronous (messages put on queue and processed later)
Use Case in T24:
- Batch file uploads
- Payment messages (SWIFT, ISO20022)
- ATM/Card transactions via switch
- Large volume data transfers
Data Format: XML, ISO8583, ISO20022, JSON (customized per integration)
Better for bulk / high volume messaging
Example: End of Day (EOD) batch posting to clearing house
Best for asynchronous, bulk, guaranteed delivery (payments, ATM, card switches, batch jobs).

***********************************************************************************************************************************************************


What is IRIS (Integration and Real-time Interaction Services)
IRIS is Temenos’ integration layer that provides APIs and services for T24.
Think of it as Temenos’ API gateway / middleware framework.
IRIS = Temenos integration layer for synchronous real-time API/service communication.
Synchronous (real-time request/response API calls)
Use Case in T24:
- Mobile/Internet banking APIs
- Balance enquiry, mini statement
- Loan/Deposit product services
- Real-time customer onboarding
Data Format: REST (JSON), SOAP (XML)
Better for real-time low-latency interactions
Example:Mobile banking app fetching balance instantly
Best for synchronous, real-time API calls (mobile banking, fintech apps, internet banking).

***********************************************************************************************************************************************************


Architecture-->
Front-end channels: Internet Banking, Mobile, ATM, Branch Teller
Core system: T24 (jBASE, TAFJ, COB engine)
Integration layer: OFS (Open Financial Services), IRIS (Interface), Kafka/MQ
Reporting layer: Temenos Reporting, regulatory feeds

***********************************************************************************************************************************************************


IRIS in T24  -->
T24 Integration & Reporting Interface. IRIS is a reporting & enquiry engine in T24 used to extract data from the core banking system and present it in a structured way
Automates reporting, batch integrations.
Testing: validate reports generated + data reconciled with DB.

T24 Transaction (FT, ST, AA, etc.) -> Core Tables (LIVE / HISTORY) -> IRIS Extract Layer ->  Enquiry / Report Definition (e.g., ENQ.CUST.BALANCE) -> Output:
                                                                                                                                                                 - On Screen (UI Enquiry)
                                                                                                                                                                 - Download (Excel/CSV/PDF)
                                                                                                                                                                 - Feed to downstream (Regulatory / MIS)
	When testing IRIS, you should validate:
                                            Access Control – Restricted data (like VIP customers) should not be visible.
                                            Formats – Excel/CSV/PDF outputs must be consistent.
                                            Data Accuracy – Matches source (e.g., FT transaction → reflected in IRIS report).											

What’s the difference between IRIS and Enquiry?
👉 Enquiry = simple search/report from a single application.
👉 IRIS = advanced reporting, can combine multiple modules/tables + export + feed external systems.

MIS(Management Information System) -->
MIS is a system of reports and dashboards that provides management-level insights into banking operations.
It gathers data from T24 (and other systems) → processes it → presents it in summary form for decision-making.

Difference between MIS and IRIS in T24?
👉 IRIS = Tool inside T24 to build reports & enquiries.
👉 MIS = Final set of summarized reports/dashboards (often built using IRIS or Data Warehouse).

***********************************************************************************************************************************************************


T24 Outbox -->
Messaging interface where transactions are queued for external systems.
Validate message format, status (processed, pending).
Automation can poll Outbox DB table and validate content.
Outbox = interface layer in T24 where outgoing messages (payment instructions, advices, confirmations, SWIFT, etc.) 
are generated and stored before being sent to external systems (SWIFT, Clearing House, Middleware, etc.).

T24 Transaction (FT, LD, AA, TD…) -> OFS / Application Processing -> Message Generation (based on templates: SWIFT, XML, ISO20022, etc.) -> OUT/BOX (Outbox tables in T24) -> Interface / Middleware Pickup (e.g., MQ, Kafka, API)  -> External System (SWIFT, ACH, RTGS, Partner Banks)

Types of Messages in Outbox
SWIFT Messages (MT103, MT202, MT940, MT950).
ISO20022 Messages (pacs.008, camt.053).
Regulatory Messages (AML, FATCA, CRS).
Customer Advices (payment confirmation, statement).

Q: What is T24 Outbox?
👉 It’s a staging area where outgoing messages are stored after transaction posting, before being delivered to external systems like SWIFT or ACH.

Q: How do you test Outbox messages?
👉 Validate message format, field mappings, status updates, delivery to correct channel, error handling, and reconciliation with source transaction.

*********************************************************************************************************************************************************
T24 OFS -->
Open Financial Services → API messaging protocol.
It allows external systems (Mobile App, Internet Banking, Payment Gateway, CRM, ATM, SWIFT, etc.) to interact with T24 in real-time.
Messages are in flat text format, not XML/JSON

Types of OFS Messages->
INPUTT (Create transaction (FT, Loans, Deposits)), ENQUIRY.SELECT → Fetch data (balances, customer info) , AUTHORISE (Authorize a transaction)
REVERSE → Reverse a transaction , HOLD/RELEASE → Place hold on funds

              *******OFS   vs  Web Services  ********
																												
1. Technology
   ├─ OFS: Flat text-based, key=value pairs
   └─ Web Services: XML (SOAP) or JSON (REST)

2. Transport/Integration
   ├─ OFS: Sent via OFSML, MQ, File upload, or Browser input
   └─ Web Services: HTTP/HTTPS calls, API gateways  

3. Usage
   ├─ OFS: Internal core banking operations (FT, Customer creation, COB jobs)
   └─ Web Services: Exposed to external systems (Mobile app, Internet banking, Fintech)
   

4. Format Example
   ├─ OFS: 
       OFSHEADER,INPUTT,FT.VERSION
       ACCOUNT:DEBIT=123,ACCOUNT:CREDIT=456,AMOUNT=1000
   └─ Web Service (REST):
       POST /fund-transfer
       {
         "debitAccount": "123",
         "creditAccount": "456",
         "amount": "1000",
         "currency": "AED"
       }
	   
Send OFS request → capture response → validate in DB & Outbox queue.
Automate via Rest Assured + DB verification.

***********************************************************************************************************************************************************

T24 COB (Close of Business) key validations -->
Interest accrual & application.
GL balances reconciliation.
End-of-day posting & batch jobs.
No pending/unbalanced transactions.
Reports generation.

How do you test T24 Interfaces (like SWIFT, Kafka, MQ)?  -->

Trigger transaction in T24 (e.g., SWIFT payment).
Validate Outbox table entry created.
Check Kafka/MQ queue → correct ISO20022/SWIFT message generated.

Automation:
API/UI to trigger transaction.
DB query for Outbox.
Kafka/MQ consumer to fetch message → validate content.

***********************************************************************************************************************************************************



What are key challenges in T24 test automation? How do you solve them? --> 

Complex DB validations → use JDBC utils.
OFS message parsing → build reusable parsers.
COB execution time → run smoke validations early (shift-left).
Integration with Kafka/MQ → custom consumers.
Huge regression suite → use tagging, parallel execution in CI/CD.


***********************************************************************************************************************************************************

COB Automaiton -->
1.COB Trigger / Start
Automation Tasks:
Run shell/command/script to trigger COB (tRunCOB.sh or batch script).

8.Payments Hub
Manages SWIFT, SEPA, ACH, RTGS.
Connects with Payment Gateway or Central Bank.

***********************************************************************************************************************************************************



What is the difference between Application, Version, and Enquiry?
Application = Base module (FT).
Version = Customized form (FT.CORP).
Enquiry = Reporting/search (ENQ.CUST.BALANCE).


***********************************************************************************************************************************************************


Kafka / IBM MQ with T24   -->

Kafka -->
 Used Kafka for real-time event streaming between T24 and external systems (e.g., Payment Hub, Mobile Banking, CRM).
 Worked on schema registry & serialization (Avro/JSON/Protobuf) for ensuring data compatibility.
 
 IBM MQ (Message Queuing) -->
 Used MQ as a middleware layer between T24 and legacy systems.
 Configured and tested MQ channels, queues, and queue managers for OFS messages.

SWIFT Gateway --->
SWIFT = Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication.
It’s a global messaging network banks use to securely exchange payment instructions.
It doesn’t transfer money itself, but it ensures the payment instructions reach the right bank in the correct format.

Example: If Bank A (UAE) sends money to Bank B (India), the instructions travel over SWIFT.

What is T24?
T24 (now called Temenos Transact) is a Core Banking Software developed by Temenos.
It’s one of the most widely used core banking systems (CBS) across the globe, deployed by retail banks, corporate banks, microfinance institutions, and Islamic banks.
Usage: It helps banks manage customer accounts, deposits, loans, payments, treasury, trade finance, compliance, and reporting.

T24 layers for testing:
1. Presentation Layer
What it is: User Interfaces – browser (Web), mobile app, desktop.
Testing focus:
- UI rendering and navigation
- Screen field validations
- Multi-language and localization
- Browser/device compatibility
- Accessibility 

2. Application Layer (Business Logic Layer)
What it is: Core banking business rules and workflows within T24 modules (e.g., Accounts, Loans, Deposits, Payments).
Testing focus:
- Functional validation of product configuration (e.g., account creation, interest calculation, charges).
- End-to-end transaction flows across modules.
- Parameter and version testing.
- COB (Close of Business) / EOD (End of Day) testing.
- Regression of business rules after upgrades.

3. Integration Layer
What it is: Interfaces via T24 Integration Framework (TAFJ/IRIS/TCIB), APIs, MQ, ESB, Kafka, or REST/SOAP web services.
Testing focus:
- API/Interface contract validation
- Message formatting (ISO20022, SWIFT, XML, JSON)
- Middleware queue handling (MQ/Kafka)
- Real-time and batch integrations with external systems (CRM, Cards, Payments, AML, Reporting).
- Error handling and retry logic.

4. Database Layer
What it is: Underlying database (Oracle, DB2, MS SQL depending on deployment).
Testing focus:
- Data integrity and consistency
- Record locking and transaction management
- COB batch updates and rollbacks
- Performance of complex queries
- Data migration/ETL validation

5. Infrastructure Layer
What it is: Hosting and deployment environment (On-prem / Cloud). Includes OS, app server, network, clustering, containerization.
Testing focus:
- High availability, DR (Disaster Recovery)
- Failover and load balancing
- Performance testing under peak load
- Security (authentication, authorization, encryption)
- Monitoring and logging

Issues which may arise at different layers:
 UI bug, integration message mismatch, database corruption, or infrastructure bottleneck

***********************************************************************************************************************************************************


What is MQ(Message queue):
MQ stands for Message Queue, typically referring to IBM MQ (WebSphere MQ) in banking environments.
It’s a middleware messaging system that lets applications exchange data asynchronously.
MQ = Middleware for asynchronous message exchange (queue-based)
Asynchronous (messages put on queue and processed later)
Use Case in T24:
- Batch file uploads
- Payment messages (SWIFT, ISO20022)
- ATM/Card transactions via switch
- Large volume data transfers
Data Format: XML, ISO8583, ISO20022, JSON (customized per integration)
Better for bulk / high volume messaging
Example: End of Day (EOD) batch posting to clearing house
Best for asynchronous, bulk, guaranteed delivery (payments, ATM, card switches, batch jobs).

***********************************************************************************************************************************************************


What is IRIS (Integration and Real-time Interaction Services)
IRIS is Temenos’ integration layer that provides APIs and services for T24.
Think of it as Temenos’ API gateway / middleware framework.
IRIS = Temenos integration layer for synchronous real-time API/service communication.
Synchronous (real-time request/response API calls)
Use Case in T24:
- Mobile/Internet banking APIs
- Balance enquiry, mini statement
- Loan/Deposit product services
- Real-time customer onboarding
Data Format: REST (JSON), SOAP (XML)
Better for real-time low-latency interactions
Example:Mobile banking app fetching balance instantly
Best for synchronous, real-time API calls (mobile banking, fintech apps, internet banking).

***********************************************************************************************************************************************************


Architecture-->
Front-end channels: Internet Banking, Mobile, ATM, Branch Teller
Core system: T24 (jBASE, TAFJ, COB engine)
Integration layer: OFS (Open Financial Services), IRIS (Interface), Kafka/MQ
Reporting layer: Temenos Reporting, regulatory feeds

***********************************************************************************************************************************************************


IRIS in T24  -->
T24 Integration & Reporting Interface. IRIS is a reporting & enquiry engine in T24 used to extract data from the core banking system and present it in a structured way
Automates reporting, batch integrations.
Testing: validate reports generated + data reconciled with DB.

T24 Transaction (FT, ST, AA, etc.) -> Core Tables (LIVE / HISTORY) -> IRIS Extract Layer ->  Enquiry / Report Definition (e.g., ENQ.CUST.BALANCE) -> Output:
                                                                                                                                                                 - On Screen (UI Enquiry)
                                                                                                                                                                 - Download (Excel/CSV/PDF)
                                                                                                                                                                 - Feed to downstream (Regulatory / MIS)
	When testing IRIS, you should validate:
                                            Access Control – Restricted data (like VIP customers) should not be visible.
                                            Formats – Excel/CSV/PDF outputs must be consistent.
                                            Data Accuracy – Matches source (e.g., FT transaction → reflected in IRIS report).											

What’s the difference between IRIS and Enquiry?
👉 Enquiry = simple search/report from a single application.
👉 IRIS = advanced reporting, can combine multiple modules/tables + export + feed external systems.

MIS(Management Information System) -->
MIS is a system of reports and dashboards that provides management-level insights into banking operations.
It gathers data from T24 (and other systems) → processes it → presents it in summary form for decision-making.

Difference between MIS and IRIS in T24?
👉 IRIS = Tool inside T24 to build reports & enquiries.
👉 MIS = Final set of summarized reports/dashboards (often built using IRIS or Data Warehouse).

***********************************************************************************************************************************************************


T24 Outbox -->
Messaging interface where transactions are queued for external systems.
Validate message format, status (processed, pending).
Automation can poll Outbox DB table and validate content.
Outbox = interface layer in T24 where outgoing messages (payment instructions, advices, confirmations, SWIFT, etc.) 
are generated and stored before being sent to external systems (SWIFT, Clearing House, Middleware, etc.).

T24 Transaction (FT, LD, AA, TD…) -> OFS / Application Processing -> Message Generation (based on templates: SWIFT, XML, ISO20022, etc.) -> OUT/BOX (Outbox tables in T24) -> Interface / Middleware Pickup (e.g., MQ, Kafka, API)  -> External System (SWIFT, ACH, RTGS, Partner Banks)

Types of Messages in Outbox
SWIFT Messages (MT103, MT202, MT940, MT950).
ISO20022 Messages (pacs.008, camt.053).
Regulatory Messages (AML, FATCA, CRS).
Customer Advices (payment confirmation, statement).

Q: What is T24 Outbox?
👉 It’s a staging area where outgoing messages are stored after transaction posting, before being delivered to external systems like SWIFT or ACH.

Q: How do you test Outbox messages?
👉 Validate message format, field mappings, status updates, delivery to correct channel, error handling, and reconciliation with source transaction.

*********************************************************************************************************************************************************
T24 OFS -->
Open Financial Services → API messaging protocol.
It allows external systems (Mobile App, Internet Banking, Payment Gateway, CRM, ATM, SWIFT, etc.) to interact with T24 in real-time.
Messages are in flat text format, not XML/JSON

Types of OFS Messages->
INPUTT (Create transaction (FT, Loans, Deposits)), ENQUIRY.SELECT → Fetch data (balances, customer info) , AUTHORISE (Authorize a transaction)
REVERSE → Reverse a transaction , HOLD/RELEASE → Place hold on funds

1. Technology
   ├─ OFS: Flat text-based, key=value pairs
   └─ Web Services: XML (SOAP) or JSON (REST)

2. Transport/Integration
   ├─ OFS: Sent via OFSML, MQ, File upload, or Browser input
   └─ Web Services: HTTP/HTTPS calls, API gateways  

3. Usage
   ├─ OFS: Internal core banking operations (FT, Customer creation, COB jobs)
   └─ Web Services: Exposed to external systems (Mobile app, Internet banking, Fintech)
   

4. Format Example
   ├─ OFS: 
       OFSHEADER,INPUTT,FT.VERSION
       ACCOUNT:DEBIT=123,ACCOUNT:CREDIT=456,AMOUNT=1000
   └─ Web Service (REST):
       POST /fund-transfer
       {
         "debitAccount": "123",
         "creditAccount": "456",
         "amount": "1000",
         "currency": "AED"
       }
	   
Send OFS request → capture response → validate in DB & Outbox queue.
Automate via Rest Assured + DB verification.

How do you test OFS messages automatically?
A:
Create test scripts (Java/RestAssured/Python) to send OFS request.
Validate:
Response format (SUCCESS, FAIL, error codes).
Database update (ACCOUNT, CUSTOMER, FT tables).
GL postings.
Example: Automated script sends FUNDS.TRANSFER OFS, validates debit/credit balances.

Error Handling & Reconciliation
Q7: How do you handle OFS errors in T24?
A7:
Check OFS.ERROR table for failed messages.
Retry via OFS.PROCESS.
Ensure field mapping & versions are correct.
Reconcile with external system (SwiftNet, ACH) logs.

T24 Basics  -->
T24 (Temenos 24) is a Core Banking System (CBS)
Retail → Savings, current accounts, loans.
Corporate → Trade finance, treasury.
Private Banking → Wealth products.
Islamic Banking → Murabaha, Sukuk, Ijara.

Core Modules (Functional Banking Flows)  -->
1.Customer (CUSTOMER table)
stores personal & corporate details.
KYC/AML checks applied.
Example: A new customer is onboarded, then accounts can be linked.
Workflow: Input → KYC/AML → Maker → Checker → CIF generated.

2.Accounts (ACCOUNT table)
Types: Savings, Current, Fixed Deposit.
Each has balance, interest rules, GL links.

3.Funds Transfer (FT table)
Used for Payments.
Can be internal (between same bank accounts) or external (SWIFT/ACH/RTGS).
Example: Salary credit, utility payment.
Workflow: Input FT → Validation (Balance, AML, Limits) → Authorization → GL Posting → Outbound Message.

4.Arrangement Architecture (AA)
Manages loans, deposits, overdrafts, mortgages.
Handles schedules (installments, repayments).
Workflow: Product setup → Loan request → Limit check → Disbursement → Repayment schedule.

5.Lending (LOANS table)
For loan accounts → disbursement, EMI calculation, overdue checks.

6.Treasury
For bank’s internal operations: FX deals, derivatives, money markets.

7.Trade Finance
LC (Letter of Credit), Guarantees, Import/Export Bills.

8.Payments Hub
Manages SWIFT, SEPA, ACH, RTGS.
Connects with Payment Gateway or Central Bank.

***********************************************************************************************************************************************************

What is the difference between Application, Version, and Enquiry?
Application = Base module (FT).
Version = Customized form (FT.CORP).
Enquiry = Reporting/search (ENQ.CUST.BALANCE).


***********************************************************************************************************************************************************


Kafka / IBM MQ with T24   -->

Kafka -->
 Used Kafka for real-time event streaming between T24 and external systems (e.g., Payment Hub, Mobile Banking, CRM).
 Worked on schema registry & serialization (Avro/JSON/Protobuf) for ensuring data compatibility.
 
 IBM MQ (Message Queuing) -->
 Used MQ as a middleware layer between T24 and legacy systems.
 Configured and tested MQ channels, queues, and queue managers for OFS messages.

***********************************************************************************************************************************************************


SWIFT Gateway --->
SWIFT = Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication.
It’s a global messaging network banks use to securely exchange payment instructions.
It doesn’t transfer money itself, but it ensures the payment instructions reach the right bank in the correct format.

Example: If Bank A (UAE) sends money to Bank B (India), the instructions travel over SWIFT.

 Customer (UAE) --> T24 (Payment Module)

   SWIFT (Network)      <-- ACK (Accepted)
                        <-- NACK (Rejected)

***********************************************************************************************************************

Temenos Local Development (jBASE, TAFC/TAP, TAFJ)

Q: What’s the difference between TAFC and TAFJ, and in what scenarios have you used jBASE?
TAFC (Temenos Application Framework for C) → Runs on jBASE, used for traditional on-prem core banking systems. It’s lightweight and suitable for legacy deployments.
TAFJ (Temenos Application Framework for Java) → Built on Java, designed for scalability, high availability, and integration with microservices/cloud.
jBASE → I used it for writing local routines, enquiry modifications, OFS message parsing, and creating batch programs.
Example: I built a local routine in jBASE for a custom validation in Funds Transfer (FT), ensuring debit account had sufficient balance before COB posting.

*****************************************************************************************************************************

Q: How does T24 handle the lifecycle of a payment transaction from initiation to settlement?
Initiation → User/system sends request via OFS/API.
Validation → T24 checks account balance, customer status, AML rules.
Booking → Temporary records created in FT application.
Authorization → Dual control or automated STP (Straight Through Processing).
Settlement → Payment message formatted (SWIFT MT/ISO20022 XML) and sent to the clearing system.
Accounting → GL entries generated, balances updated.
Reconciliation → Settlement confirmation, error handling, retry if needed.

*********************************************************************************************************************
What is the difference between SWIFT MT and ISO20022 MX messages in T24 Payments?

SWIFT MT → Legacy format, text-based, widely used in cross-border payments. Example: MT103 (Customer Transfer).
ISO20022 MX → XML-based, structured, richer data, supports regulatory compliance. Example: pacs.008 (Customer Credit Transfer).

**********************************************************************************************************************

OFS message failure with error ACCOUNT.NO.INVALID. How do you troubleshoot?

Check raw OFS message format (field separators, transaction ID).
Validate account number in CUSTOMER/ACCOUNTS application.
Verify local routine validations or field-level controls.
Review jBASE logs or T24 enquiry (ENQUIRY SELECT).
If from API Hub → check API Hub logs, TIF mappings.
Fix root cause (e.g., wrong account, missing currency code).


********************************************************************

T24 Wealth module integrate with core banking? --->>>
Wealth module handles investment accounts, securities, portfolio management.
Integration with core customer data ensures a single customer view.
Transactions in Wealth generate GL postings in T24 Core.

*********************************************************************

You deployed a new local routine in FT module but COB batch job fails. How do you fix it?
A:
Check COB job logs (BNK.RUN) for error trace.
Run the FT transaction manually to reproduce issue.
Debug local routine in jBASE (CALL stack trace).
Verify routine parameters (incorrect handling of NULL values is common).
Fix and redeploy routine → run COB in retry mode (BNK.EOD, RETRY).

************************************************************************

What is Temenos TestMaster and how does it help in automation?
A:
Temenos TestMaster is the official automation tool for T24.
Features:
Automates UI, API, OFS, COB testing.

I’ve used TestMaster for regression packs in Payments and Lending modules, reducing manual effort by 60%.

*************************************************************************************************************************************

How do you performance test OFS messages in T24?
A:
Use JMeter or Gatling to simulate high volume OFS requests.
Example: 5000 FT requests in 10 minutes.
Validate:
Response times < 1 sec for each OFS.
No COB impact.
DB locks & memory usage stable.
Report with percentiles (P90, P95).

****************************************************************************************************

5. GL Mismatch
Q: After COB, GL balances don’t match with customer balances. How do you resolve?
A:
Run TRIAL.BALANCE enquiry and compare with CUSTOMER.STMT.
Check for unauthorized FT/LD transactions.
Look at reversal postings (sometimes auto-reversal fails).
If issue is batch-specific → reprocess failed transactions manually.
Automation Fix: Build a post-COB validation script to compare GL vs Account balances automatically.

***********************************************************************************************************

COB Performance

Q: COB that usually takes 2 hours now takes 5 hours. What could be the reason?
A:
Check long-running jobs in BNK.JOB.LIST.
Look for locking issues (jobs waiting for transaction unlock).
Analyze SQL queries for slow joins/missing indexes.
Verify if parallel jobs are queued instead of running concurrently.
Automation Insight: Set up monitoring scripts to track average job runtime and raise alerts if threshold exceeded.

*************************************************************************************************************

What is Arrangement Architecture in T24?
A3:
AA provides a flexible contract management framework for products like Lending, Deposits, Overdrafts.
Instead of hardcoding, products are configured via rules & conditions (interest, fees, repayment schedules).
Supports reusability, rapid product launch, and parameter-driven design.

AA Contract use case?
For a loan product, I configured:
Interest = Base + Spread
Repayment = EMI monthly
Penalty = % of overdue amount
The AA Contract automatically calculated schedules and posted accounting entries during COB.


How do you improve performance in T24 (TAFJ)?
A5:
Use multi-threading and batch splitting for COB.
Optimize jBASE routines / Java code for loops and DB calls.
Use Temenos Batch Performance Monitor (BPM) to analyze bottlenecks.
Tune Oracle/DB2 queries for indexing.

Q6: Difference between performance in TAFC vs TAFJ?
A6:
TAFC (jBASE): Faster for smaller banks, limited scalability.
TAFJ (Java-based): Supports high concurrency, APIs, microservices, but requires more tuning (JVM heap, GC).


Q7: How do you handle OFS errors in T24?
A7:
Check OFS.ERROR table for failed messages.
Retry via OFS.PROCESS.
Ensure field mapping & versions are correct.
Reconcile with external system (SwiftNet, ACH) logs.

Q8: How do you reconcile settlement mismatches?
A8:
Use RECON module for automated reconciliation.
Compare incoming/outgoing messages with GL entries.
Investigate suspense accounts and adjust via manual journal if required.



Q9 You deployed a new local routine in FT module, but the COB batch job fails. How do you fix it?
A:
Check COB job logs (BNK.RUN) for error trace.
Run the FT transaction manually to reproduce the issue.
Debug local routine in jBASE (CALL stack trace).
Verify routine parameters (incorrect handling of NULL values is common).
Fix and redeploy routine → run COB in retry mode (BNK.EOD, RETRY).



Q: How do you design an automation strategy for T24?
A:
UI Automation → For T24 Browser/Classic screens (Selenium, Playwright).
API Automation → OFS messages, Temenos API Hub (RestAssured, Postman, Karate).
COB Automation → Batch scripts, Jenkins jobs, T24 TestMaster.
Database Validation → SQL queries against Oracle/DB2 for GL and account checks.
Performance Testing → JMeter, Gatling for OFS/API load.


GL Mismatch
Q: After COB, GL balances don’t match with customer balances. How do you resolve?
A:
Run TRIAL.BALANCE enquiry and compare with CUSTOMER.STMT.
Check for unauthorized FT/LD transactions.
Look at reversal postings (sometimes auto-reversal fails).
If issue is batch-specific → reprocess failed transactions manually.
Automation Fix: Build a post-COB validation script to compare GL vs Account balances automatically.



What is ISO20022, and why is it important in T24 payments?
A12:
ISO20022: A universal standard for financial messages in XML.
Used for cross-border payments, enabling rich remittance data.
T24 maps ISO20022 fields into internal OFS structures for processing.

WIFT: Cross-border, uses MT/MX formats. T24 integrates via SWIFTNet.
ACH/FPS: Domestic clearing (batch/real-time). ACH uses NACHA standards, FPS is real-time settlement.



security managed in T24?  ---> User Profiles & Roles – access based on job function. ,, Maker-Checker Control – dual authorization for sensitive transactions.



Important Note -------->
Work Experince ---> 
I have worked on Core, Accounts, Payments, Lending, Treasury, and Wealth modules. 
My role involved writing OFS-based interfaces, developing local routines, parameterization, SIT/UAT support, and automating regression packs.
For example, in Lending, I implemented loan disbursement logic using T24 local routines, and in Payments, 
I configured swift message validation and settlement workflows.

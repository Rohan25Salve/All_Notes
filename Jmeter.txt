What is the test plan in JMeter?
--> A test plan in JMeter is a container for all test elements, including thread groups, samplers, listeners, and configurations.
* It defines the flow and structure of your performance tests.
  All kind of action under test folder 
 
 
 How do you handle dynamic data (e.g., session IDs) in JMeter?
--> Use Regular Expression Extractor or JSON Extractor to capture dynamic values like session IDs or tokens from responses 
and pass them to subsequent requests.

What is a Thread Group in JMeter?

--> A Thread Group is a container that simulates user threads (virtual users). You can configure:
Number of threads (users): Number of concurrent users.
Ramp-up period: Time to start all threads.
Loop count: Number of iterations for each thread.


What are key metrics you analyze in a JMeter test report?
Answer:
Key Metrics:
*Response Time (Avg, Min, Max): Time taken to get a response from the server.
*Throughput: Number of requests processed per second.
*Error Rate: Percentage of failed requests.
*Latency: Time taken for the server to start sending a response.
*Hits Per Second: Number of requests sent to the server every second.
*Latency: Time taken to send a request to the server.

How do you analyze test results in JMeter?

--> Use listeners like:
Aggregate Report: Analyze response time, throughput, and error percentage.
Response Time Graph: Identify bottlenecks.
Summary Report: High-level performance overview.

What is distributed testing in JMeter?

--> Distributed testing allows running tests on multiple machines to simulate a large user load. JMeter uses a master-slave configuration:
The master coordinates test execution.
The slaves generate the load.


Can JMeter integrate with CI/CD pipelines? How?

--> Yes, integrate JMeter with tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI/CD by:
Using JMeter Maven Plugin or command-line execution.
Generate HTML or JTL reports post-execution for analysis.

execute JMeter scripts from the command line?

--> jmeter -n -t projrctName.jmx -l c:\path of folder save the result -e -o /path/to/report

-n = non GUI Mode
-t = test file plan 
-l = log the file on this folder 
-o = HTML report Genration 


What are some plugins you’ve used in JMeter?

JMeter Plugins Manager allows adding extensions. 
Custom Thread Groups: Flexible user load simulation.
a) Thread Group --> Number of Thread , Ramp-up period , Loop count
b) Concurrency Thread Group --> Target Concurrency , Ramp-up time , Ramp-up Step Count , Hold Target Rate limit
c) Ultimate Tread Group --> Start thread count , intial dealy, Startup time , Hold Load, ShutDown time 
BlazeMeter Reporting Plugin: Enhanced reporting.
PerfMon Plugin: To monitor server performance.
Throughput Shaping Timer: To control the throughput dynamically.


How to test file uploads with JMeter?

-->Use the HTTP Request sampler with POST method.
Add the file under the "Files Upload" section.


What’s the difference between a Response Time and Latency in JMeter?

Response Time: Time taken to complete the entire request-response cycle.
Latency: Time taken for the server to respond to the first byte of the request.


How do you monitor server performance during load testing?

--> Use tools like PerfMon or APM tools (e.g., New Relic, Dynatrace) to monitor CPU, memory, and network usage.

How do you test microservices with dependencies using JMeter?
Answer:
Use Service Virtualization or mock tools like WireMock to simulate unavailable services.
Test individual microservices by focusing on:
API responses.
Inter-service communication latency.

 APIs requiring OAuth 2.0 authentication in JMeter?
--> Use an HTTP Request to generate the token from the OAuth endpoint.
Extract the token using a JSON Extractor.
Pass the token in subsequent requests using an HTTP Header Manager:

 ------->>>> What are some common challenges faced when using BlazeMeter with JMeter, and how can they be mitigated?
Answer:

Data Consistency:
Challenge: Handling dynamic data (e.g., session tokens or IDs) can be difficult when using JMeter with BlazeMeter.
Solution: Use JMeter’s Regular Expression Extractor or JSON Extractor to capture dynamic data during the test and pass it between requests.
Test Script Compatibility:

Challenge: Sometimes JMeter scripts may not work as expected when uploaded to BlazeMeter due to differences in configurations.
Solution: Before uploading to BlazeMeter, run the JMeter script locally and ensure all dependencies and plugins are correctly configured.
Network Latency:

Challenge: Running tests from BlazeMeter’s cloud servers may introduce additional network latency, especially if the servers are located far from the application’s target region.
Solution: BlazeMeter allows you to choose different geographic regions for running tests to reduce latency and get more accurate results for real-world conditions.
Scaling Test Size:

Challenge: Running tests at a very high load might lead to unanticipated resource limits.
Solution: Start with smaller loads and gradually increase the scale while monitoring resource consumption to identify any system limitations.

✅ Use JMeter Plugins
Plugins like PerfMon Metrics Collector help track CPU, memory, and I/O stats.
✅Visualize with Grafana + InfluxDB
Grafana dashboards give real-time insights into performance trends.


************            Deep Dive into JMeter Listeners & Reports     **********************************
Summary Report – Quick performance stats (Average, Min, Max, Throughput).
Aggregate Report – Percentile-based analysis.
View Results Tree – Debugging request/response details.
Response Time Graph – Identify slow responses over time


Correlating Performance Issues with Logs & Monitoring ----->>>>> 
Check application logs (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk) to correlate slow responses with backend errors.
Server monitoring tools (e.g., New Relic, Dynatrace, Prometheus) help track system health under load.



***************      Best Practices for Reliable Testing  ****************

Use Ramp-Up Period – Avoid sudden spikes; simulate realistic traffic.
Add Think Time – Simulate user delays to avoid unrealistic stress.
Parameterize Requests – Use dynamic data to avoid caching effects.
Use Assertions – Verify response correctness, not just response time.
Run Tests in Non-Prod Environments – Avoid impacting real users.

************    Controllers ***************
Controllers help define the logic of execution within a test plan. They determine how and when requests are executed.

Samplers Controllers (Execution Controllers) -> These directly send requests (like HTTP, FTP, JDBC, SOAP, etc.).
Logic Controllers -> These control the execution flow and structure of test elements.

Repeating requests? → Loop Controller
Executing only under certain conditions? → If Controller / While Controller
Randomized execution? → Random Controller
Grouping requests logically? → Simple Controller
Measuring total transaction time? → Transaction Controller


*********************   Config Element **************

Config Element	                             Purpose
CSV Data Set Config	                     Reads test data from a CSV file (e.g., usernames, passwords).
HTTP Request Defaults	                     Sets default values for HTTP requests (e.g., Base URL).
User Defined Variables	                     Stores reusable variables for test execution.
Random Variable	Generates                    random numbers (e.g., for dynamic IDs).
BeanShell PreProcessor	                     Runs custom Java code before a request executes.
DNS Cache Manager	                     Manages DNS resolution to simulate different network environments.
Counter                                      generates an incrementing (or looping) number, Provide unique values for requests,Simulate iterations with dynamic 
                                              values.

***************  Sampler JMeter ***************

JSR223 Sampler --> powerful scripting sampler in JMeter that allows you to write custom scripts using languages like
✅ Groovy (Recommended)
✅ JavaScript
✅ Java
✅ BeanShell
* Perform custom calculations or logic during a test  * Dynamically modify requests or responses.

✅ Testing APIs? → HTTP Request Sampler
✅ Database Testing? → JDBC Request Sampler
✅ Message Queue Testing? → JMS Sampler
✅ Email Functionality? → SMTP Sampler
✅ File Uploads? → FTP Sampler
✅ Custom Logic? ( Executes custom Java code during the test.) → JSR223 or BeanShell Sampler
✅ Prints all JMeter variables & properties in the log for debugging → Debug Sampler
